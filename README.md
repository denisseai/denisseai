## Hi, I'm Denisse
*****************************
After some years as a cook, I decided to switch careers to software development. I'm a recent Ada developerâ€™s academy graduate in Seattle. At the beginning of the year, I completed my first software engineering internship. I'm currently looking for my first position as a SDE. In my spare time you will find me cooking, taking care of my dogs, and caring about the environment.
